# What correlations to look for ? 
# When looking just for Re-Al or Al-Fi correlation with one alpha, 
# be sure to set number of alphas to 1 !!! (otherwise the search will 
# continue with further generations)

# Use back detector in correlations ?

# Use (X or Y) energy in low energy correlations ? (Otherwise only X energy is used)
